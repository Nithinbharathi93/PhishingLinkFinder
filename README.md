## Features

- **Google Search Integration**: Fetches the top official websites of the given organization.
- **IP Address Comparison**: Resolves the IP address of the suspicious link and compares it with the official domain.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays whether the link is legitimate or suspicious in real time.
